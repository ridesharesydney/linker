<h3>--- FAQ ---</h3>

<h4 onclick="toggleAnswer('q1')">What's being done?</h4>
<div id="q1" class="answer">   
 <p>With the announcement on the 4th July 2024, it's still early days, but a small team are currently investigating the options. This may be join a union, it may be a 'strike', for want of a better word - but trust us we will have our voice heard!</br> For the time being, please join the chat and we'll update you there. Please note, it might take a few days for us to set a few plans into motion and have some discussions with lawyers, unions, etc</p>

<h4 onclick="toggleAnswer('q2')">How can I help</h4>

<h4 onclick="toggleAnswer('q3')">Why are we using this link page?</h4>
<div id="q3" class="answer">
    <p>Over time, we're needing to communicate important information out to everyone, and eventually one chat group isn't going to be enough!
    This page will be updated over time with links to important news articles and other information. But in the meantime, above is the link to the Telegram chat!</p>
</div>

    <h4 onclick="toggleAnswer('q4')">Why does this website look so... average?</h4>
<div id="q4" class="answer">
    <p>Honestly, because we got blindsided by a recent announcement from the rideshare company, and we needed to throw something together - fast!<br />I don't think anybody expected an announcement to decrease rates from rideshare companies, especially when the cost of living and the price of fuel is so high!</p>
</div>

    <h4 onclick="toggleAnswer('q5')">Who is the team investigating this?</h4>
<div id="q5" class="answer">
    <p>For the time being, we're just keeping to our self and we'll make some announcements soon.</p>
</div>
